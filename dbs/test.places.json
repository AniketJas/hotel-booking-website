The roof is thatched, and the 'walls' can open and close, featuring bamboo blinds which open up to gorgeous 270 degree views of the aquamarine waters on our atoll.\nOn the fast east side of the island, the hut gets great views of sunrise and sunset, and has its own private beach.\n\nThe space\nDesa Laguna is Pulau Seribu's freshest and most regenerative private island resort, featuring 11 different accommodations as well as a gorgeous bamboo lounge where all meals are served, and where you have access to free flow quality coffee, teas, mineral water, and therapeutic hot ginger water. All meals, basic beverages, and even snacks are included in your package.\n\nOur food has excellent reviews, and is served buffet style. We cater to various dietary preferences, so feel free to let us know if you are vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc. We also serve wild-caught local fish.\n\nThe island is surrounded by aquamarine waters and beautiful coral reefs, and 15 lagoons within swimming / paddling distance.\n\nThe whole island was designed with sustainability and regeneration in mind. We are solar powered and on track to being one of the most energy efficient resorts in the world, we build most of our structures with natural materials like driftwood and bamboo, we plant mangroves and baby corals to help re-wild the area and offset our carbon footprint, and we source everything as responsibly and sustainably as possible.\n\nGuest access\nDesa Laguna's common facilities include our bamboo lounge, where all our meals are served. While the lounge itself is on the island, it connects to a long open wooden deck, which has lounge chairs to sun bath and enjoy the gorgeous views of the sea, as well as our small mangrove forest. At night, you can stargaze when it's not cloudy, and we have underwater lights at the edge of our deck which attracts a variety of nocturnal sea life.\n\nIn addition to our lounge, you are welcome to explore the rest of the island, including our west beach, with views and easy access to our mangrove forest. Part of your package includes the planting of a mangrove baby seedling. There are also hammocks dotted around the island in case you'd like to snooze or read a book :)\n\nAt our equipment hut, you can select your snorkeling gear or take out one of our high quality stand up paddle boards to explore the atoll and our many lagoons.

Festive night markets pop up in Oct-March too!\n\nThe space\nI'd like to let you know beforehand that my space is only suitable for low-key guests who are okay with living in a shared flat -- guests who are considerate and respectful of other tenants and who know how to follow house rules.\n\nThe room walls are not made of concrete and are minimally soundproofed so they're not suitable for people who are very sensitive to hearing sounds/noise from neighboring quarters. However, there are house rules meant for everyone to follow for a peaceful and stress-free living. The flat is generally peaceful and not crowded compared to the average shared flats in Dubai. Tenants are professional/decent and the host is always there to moderate peace and order.\n\nApproximate dimensions\nUpper loft bed - 85cm x 185cm\nFloor to loft ceiling - 145cm\nLoft bed to ceiling - 100cm\n\nThis room is next to the kitchen and dining hall/reception so there's potential for noise.\n\n\nRoom rate may not include use of kitchen and washing machine—contact host to confirm.\n\nThere is a regular cleaner for common areas. In-room cleaning is at a fee and upon request.\n\nThe cleaner is not around 24/7. So, to maintain the cleanliness of the flat, every guest is expected to clean up after their own mess. Trash must be right away disposed at the garbage chute a few steps away from the flat main door.\n\nA single mattress, 1 set of bedding, 1 pillow and 1 towel will be provided. Extra linens and towels at a fee. Toiletries and drinking water are at an additional charge and must be requested prior to arrival or you can order from the nearby grocery with delivery service.\n\nAC is centralized among different rooms but each room has a vent. A standard AC setting is maintained.\n\nWindows and doors must be kept closed unless AC is turned off (during winter). Violators will be fined.\n\nVisitors are discouraged. If necessary, prior approval must be sought from the host. Applicable charges apply for visitors staying 4 hours or more or visiting more than 2x the duration of stay. This is to maintain the exclusivity of the penthouse facilities.",

  "extraInfo": "Other things to note\nAttention, awesome guests :\n\n1) Before your arrival, we will, of course, agree on specific times. Please know that I will do my VERY best to try and accommodate you as much as possible. But obviously, as being an Airbnb Host is not my day job, I won't always be able to arrange 8am checkins and 11pm checkouts :-O\n\n2) Unfortunately, there is no space to drop/leave luggages before check in or after check out :( However, feel free to use the Nanny Bag service, which happens to be great, and cheap.\n\n3) As a general note to first-timers, please know in advance that Airbnb flats can never be maintained as well as hotel rooms... and they shouldn't. It is a formidable community with incredible values. Kindness and sharing are at the heart of the experience :)",
